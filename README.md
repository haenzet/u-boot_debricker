u-boot_debricker
================

This phyton script was hacked together to flash u-boot or firmware of a TP-Link WDR4300. Unfortunately my router was not responding to TFTP and ymodem/xmodem was not available on this u-boot version. It makes use of the u-boot built in mw (memory write) to flash the binaries.

Use at your own risk, it might destroy your devices. I am not responsible for any damage caused directly or indirectly by this software. Only use this if you fully understand all consequences and what the script is actually doing.
