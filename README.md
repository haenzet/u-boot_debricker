u-boot_debricker
================

This phyton script was hacked together to flash u-boot or firmware of a TP-Link WDR4300. Unfortunately my router was not responding to TFTP and ymodem/xmodem was not available on this u-boot version. It makes use of the u-boot built in mw (memory write) to flash the binaries.
