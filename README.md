u-boot_debricker
================

This phyton script was hacked together to flash u-boot or firmware of a TP-Link WDR4300. Unfortunately my router was not responding to TFTP and ymodem/xmodem was not available on this u-boot version. It makes use of the u-boot built in mw (memory write) to flash the binaries.

Use at your own risk, it might destroy your devices. I am not responsible for any damage caused directly or indirectly by this software. Only use this if you fully understand all consequences and what the script is actually doing.

`How to use: ./debricker.serial.py hexconverted.dump /dev/tty.usbserial`

The file to be flashed can be obtained by converting it with xxd -c ps unhexed.bin > hexed.dump
File should contain something similar to:

```
100000ff
00000000
100000fd
00000000
100001a0
00000000
1000019e
00000000
1000019c
00000000
```

I used a [modfied u-boot from pepe2k](https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod) which has a built-in webserver to flash the actual firmware.
